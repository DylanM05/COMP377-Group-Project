# COMP377 Group Project

## Current Progress
Most functionality is completed, but the following features need to be added:

### 1. Landing Page after Authentication
- After the user is authenticated, a landing page should be displayed.

### 2. Loading Page after Registration/Redirected to Login Page
- A loading page should be shown after registration or when redirected to the login page.

### 3. User-Friendliness Improvements
- Enhance the overall user experience by making the interface more intuitive.

### 4. Error Handling
Implement error handling for the following scenarios:
- **No Face in Uploaded Image**: Handle cases where an image without a face is uploaded.
- **User Already Registered**: Check if the user is already registered, potentially by implementing a simple database to track registrations.
- **Camera Accessibility Issues**: Handle cases where the camera isn't accessible (e.g., due to permissions or device issues).
- **Authentication Failure**: Provide a clear message when authentication fails.
