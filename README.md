Most Functionality is done,

Should add:
landing page after authenticating
loading page after registering/redirected to login page.
Make a bit more user friendly
add error handling 
--If an image without a face is uploaded, 
--if that user is registered, if the camera isn't accessible,
--if the user is already registered(maybe implement a simple db?),
--Authentication failed
